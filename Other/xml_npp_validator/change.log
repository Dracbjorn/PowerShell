    <data> </data>
  will be replaced by:
    <data/>

 Warning: The new syntax for internal comments (comments inside comments) uses "<!{x}**" and "**{x}>" codes (without quotes) as markers. Since this is not same syntaxe as in previous release, you will not be able to comment/uncomment code using previous syntax. Please be careful with this feature if you used it before. Sorry for inconvenience :(
